# HV-SPDT-MOSFET-Switch

This project is a high-voltage Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) switch designed using power MOSFETs and gate driver protection circuits. It includes fault-handling mechanisms using diode-based shorting to protect the MOSFETs under overcurrent conditions. It can operate upto 1000 Volts.

## Features
- Ultra-Fast HV switching using MOSFETs, with switch speed faster than 300ns
- Fault protection 
- Designed for experimental lab environments with nanosecond level testing
- Isolation provided for LV side and HV side
- Enables user to get rid of any RC time constants using this switch

## Files
- Schematic (`.sch`) files
- Gerbers 
- Test results 
- Diagrams and documentation

## Tools Used
- EasyEDA 
- Oscilloscope for testing
- LabVIEW for TTL control
