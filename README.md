# HV-SPDT-MOSFET-Switch

This project is a high-voltage Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) switch designed using power MOSFETs and gate driver protection circuits. It includes fault-handling mechanisms using diode-based shorting to protect the MOSFETs under overcurrent conditions. It can operate upto 1000 Volts.

## Features
- Ultra-Fast HV switching using HEXFETs
- Fault protection 
- Designed for experimental lab environments with nanosecond level testing

## Files
- Schematic (`.sch`) files
- Gerbers 
- Test results (scope captures, CSV)
- Diagrams and documentation

## Tools Used
- EasyEDA 
- Oscilloscope for testing
- LabVIEW for TTL control
